CLI
All the functionality of Docker-Compose is executed through its build in CLI, which has a very similar set of commands to what is offered by Docker.
build    Build or rebuild services 
help     Get help on a command 
kill     Kill containers 
logs     View output from containers 
port     Print the public port for a port binding 
ps       List containers 
pull     Pulls service images 
rm       Remove stopped containers 
run      Run a one-off command 
scale    Set number of containers for a service 
start    Start services 
stop     Stop services 
restart  Restart services 
up       Create and start containers
down     Stops and removes containers
They are not only similar but also behave like their Docker counterparts. The only difference is that they affect the entire multi-container architecture which is defined in the docker-compose.yml file instead of a single container.
Some Docker commands are not available anymore and have been replaced with other commands that make more sense in the context of a completely multi-container setup.
The most important new commands include the following:
    • docker-compose up 
    • docker-compose down
