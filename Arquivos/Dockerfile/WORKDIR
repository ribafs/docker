WORKDIR

WORKDIR /path/to/workdir

The WORKDIR instruction sets the working directory for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY and ADD instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile. If the WORKDIR doesn’t exist, it will be created even if it’s not used in any subsequent Dockerfile instruction.

The WORKDIR instruction can be used multiple times in a Dockerfile. If a relative path is provided, it will be relative to the path of the previous WORKDIR instruction. For example:

WORKDIR /a
WORKDIR b
WORKDIR c
RUN pwd

The output of the final pwd command in this Dockerfile would be /a/b/c.

The WORKDIR instruction can resolve environment variables previously set using ENV. You can only use environment variables explicitly set in the Dockerfile. For example:

ENV DIRPATH=/path
WORKDIR $DIRPATH/$DIRNAME
RUN pwd

The output of the final pwd command in this Dockerfile would be /path/$DIRNAME

If not specified, the default working directory is /. In practice, if you aren’t building a Dockerfile from scratch (FROM scratch), the WORKDIR may likely be set by the base image you’re using.

Therefore, to avoid unintended operations in unknown directories, it is best practice to set your WORKDIR explicitly.
